name: dispatching-to-herdr-workers
description: Use when you want Claude Code to act as orchestrator and dispatch execution tasks to CLI agent workers (agy, codex, or any other Herdr-supported kind) running in persistent Herdr-managed panes, coordinated through a stateful .agents/ ledger with task tracking, worker isolation, and diff-based review.

# Dispatching to Herdr Workers

## Overview

Claude Code (you) stays the **orchestrator**. Each **worker** is a CLI
agent of any Herdr-supported kind — `agy` (Antigravity CLI, Google), `codex`,
or any other kind `herdr agent` lists — started interactively inside a real
terminal pane managed by **Herdr**, and driven exclusively through the
`herdr` CLI (`herdr pane ...` / `herdr agent ...`) — not a native Claude
subagent, and not a one-shot headless subprocess. You always spot-check the
worker's claim yourself (cheap); an independent **Claude subagent** reviewer
is reserved for tasks that matter (see Review Policy) — dispatching a full
reviewer for every trivial task is pure overhead, not safety.

This skill was born as `dispatching-to-agy-workers` (agy-only, headless
`agy --print`). It was renamed and generalized (2026-08-13) once the Herdr
pane approach proved out for agy and the need showed up to drive other kinds
(starting with `codex`) through the exact same ledger/process. v0.5.0
(2026-08-24) renamed the plugin from `agy-orchestrator` to
`herdr-worker-orchestrator` and added stateful task tracking, worker
isolation via `git worktree`, diff-based review enforcement, and explicit
`agent_prompt_stalled` = UNKNOWN framing. Read the Lessons log below — it
carries the real, verified-by-testing history; don't re-derive what's
already there.

This is a different shape than `superpowers:dispatching-parallel-agents` or
`superpowers:subagent-driven-development`: those dispatch *native,
homogeneous* subagents inside one harness (Claude's Task tool). Here the
controller and the worker are **separate CLIs**, coordinated through
Herdr's pane/agent layer plus the filesystem — use this skill specifically
when you want a different CLI's own models/cost-profile to do the execution
work while Claude does the coordination and review.

## Hard prerequisite: Herdr

This skill requires a live Herdr session. Before anything else:

```bash
test "${HERDR_ENV:-}" = 1
```

If that fails, **stop and say so explicitly** — do not fall back to a
headless subprocess, and do not silently do the task yourself in Claude
instead. Herdr-managed panes are the only supported dispatch path, because
they're what makes lifecycle polling (`idle`/`working`/`blocked`/`done`),
mid-task follow-up prompts, and live approval flows possible at all.

Also required: `herdr`, `jq`, and the target kind's own CLI on `PATH`, with
that kind present in `herdr agent`'s supported list (run `herdr agent` to
see it — at last check: `pi|claude|codex|gemini|cursor|devin|agy|cline|omp
|mastracode|opencode|copilot|kimi|kiro|droid|amp|grok|hermes|kilo|qodercli
|maki`).

**Only `agy` and `codex` have actually been exercised against this skill's
scripts.** Any other kind will run, but treat its first few dispatches like
"a new kind of task" under the Review Policy below — its startup timing,
error codes, and workspace-scoping needs haven't been verified the way
agy's and codex's have. See "Per-kind quirks" below for how to add one once
you've verified it.

## When to Use

- You explicitly want a specific CLI's own models/cost-profile to execute a
  task while Claude coordinates, reviews, and decides next steps.
- The task benefits from a persistent worker: long-running work you want to
  poll instead of block on, work that may need a follow-up prompt without
  losing context, or work where the worker may ask a question or need
  approval mid-task (the pane stays alive, so you resolve it interactively
  instead of needing to skip permissions).

**Don't use when:** you're not inside a Herdr session (see Hard prerequisite
above), or the task is naturally a Claude subagent's job — don't reach for
an external CLI just because you can.

## Per-kind quirks

Different kinds may need different treatment to scope a worker to the right
workspace. The dispatch scripts keep a small table (`KIND_NATIVE_ARGS` in
the Python script, a `case "$KIND"` block in the bash script) of extra
native args to pass at `herdr agent start ... -- <native-args>` time:

| Kind    | Extra native args                | Why |
|---------|-----------------------------------|-----|
| `agy`   | `--add-dir <absolute-workspace>`  | agy does **not** reliably use its launching cwd as its workspace — without this it may silently write into its own `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/scratch/` while still reporting success. Verified empirically (2026-08-10). |
| `codex` | *(none)*                          | No such quirk found so far — `pane split --cwd` alone has been sufficient in testing. |
| *(any other kind)* | *(none, default)*     | Untested. If a kind silently writes to the wrong place or otherwise misbehaves, verify against real files first, then add a table entry — same discipline that caught the agy quirk. Never add an entry on assumption alone. |

Regardless of kind, **always** also repeat the absolute workspace path
inside the prompt text itself (the dispatch scripts already do this) — belt
and suspenders, since a model can still choose to write elsewhere even when
correctly scoped.

Use `scripts/dispatch-herdr-worker.sh` (macOS/Linux/Git-Bash/WSL) or
`scripts/dispatch-herdr-worker.py` (Windows, or anywhere Python is
preferred) for the deterministic happy path — either one bakes in the
per-kind table above, plus the pane split / agent start / first prompt /
read sequence below. Pick whichever runs on the orchestrating machine; never
hand-roll the `herdr` invocation sequence without one of them, except when
resolving a `blocked` worker (see step 2b — that part is inherently
interactive and not scriptable).

## State Machine & Resume (v0.5.0)

### Task lifecycle

Every dispatched task gets a JSON file in `.agents/tasks/` with a
well-defined status lifecycle:

```
pending → dispatching → working → verifying → passed
                ↓           ↓         ↓
              failed     blocked    failed
                           ↓
                        resolved → verifying → ...
```

### Task JSON schema

```json
{
  "id": "TASK-001",
  "status": "pending|dispatching|working|blocked|verifying|passed|failed",
  "worker_kind": "agy",
  "worker_name": "worker_agy_1",
  "workspace": "/abs/path",
  "pane_id": "w1H:p1",
  "agent_name": "worker_agy_1",
  "attempt": 1,
  "max_attempts": 3,
  "isolation": "none|worktree",
  "worktree_path": null,
  "worktree_branch": null,
  "started_at": "2026-08-24T00:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2026-08-24T00:00:00Z",
  "prompt": "task description...",
  "verification": {
    "files_exist": "pending|pass|fail",
    "tests": "pending|pass|fail|skipped",
    "build": "pending|pass|fail|skipped",
    "review": "pending|pass|fail|skipped"
  },
  "error": null
}
```

### Global state

`.agents/state.json` tracks which tasks are active and completed:

```json
{
  "version": "0.5.0",
  "last_updated": "2026-08-24T00:00:00Z",
  "active_tasks": ["TASK-001", "TASK-002"],
  "completed_tasks": ["TASK-000"],
  "notes": "Auto-maintained by the orchestrator."
}
```

### Resume on restart

When Claude restarts (compaction, session restart, different machine):

```
Claude restart
     ↓
read .agents/state.json
     ↓
for each task in active_tasks:
     ↓
  read .agents/tasks/TASK-xxx.json
     ↓
  herdr agent get <agent_name>
     ↓
  actual status?
   /    |      \
idle  working  blocked
  ↓      ↓       ↓
verify  wait   resolve
```

The dispatch scripts auto-write task JSON when `--task-id TASK-xxx` is
passed. If no task ID is given, the old behavior (DISPATCH.md +
progress.md only) is preserved for backward compatibility.

## Worker Isolation (v0.5.0)

### Why

Workers running in the same working directory as Claude can conflict:
- A `refactor authentication` task could break files Claude is actively
  reading or editing.
- Parallel dispatch is impossible when both workers write to the same tree.
- No clean diff boundary — hard to tell what the worker changed vs what
  was already there.

### Isolation modes

| Mode | Flag | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `none` (default) | `--isolation none` | Same cwd, same as v0.4.x. Fine for simple, single tasks. |
| `worktree` | `--isolation worktree` | Creates a `git worktree` at `.worktrees/<task-id>` on a dedicated branch. Worker's changes are fully isolated. |

### Worktree flow

```
1. git worktree add .worktrees/TASK-001 HEAD
   (creates isolated copy on branch task/TASK-001)

2. herdr pane split --cwd .worktrees/TASK-001
   (worker runs in the worktree, not the main tree)

3. Worker executes task in complete isolation

4. Orchestrator self-check:
   cd .worktrees/TASK-001 && git diff HEAD
   (see exactly what the worker changed)

5. If PASS:
   git checkout main
   git merge task/TASK-001
   (or cherry-pick specific commits)

6. Cleanup:
   git worktree remove .worktrees/TASK-001
   git branch -d task/TASK-001
```

### When to use worktree isolation

- Task touches shared/production code
- Parallel dispatch (multiple workers at once)
- Task is flagged as "important"/"quan trọng"
- Refactoring or any change with blast radius > 1 file

For scratch/exploratory work, `none` is fine.

## The `.agents/` ledger convention

Same convention this project's own `senior_product_designer_agent` uses and
Superpowers' skills use in spirit (ledger files survive context loss —
compaction, session restart, or a different machine picking up the work):

Real product files go in a sibling `workspace/` dir (or a worktree under
`.worktrees/`), never inside `.agents/` — `.agents/` is dispatch
bookkeeping only.

## The Process

0. **Clarify with the human before dispatching anything.** Same discipline
   as `superpowers:brainstorming`/`writing-plans`: if the request leaves
   real room for interpretation — scope ("simple" can mean a bare page or a
   full design system), style/aesthetic, what counts as done, how many
   workers/tabs/whatever, **which kind to use if not specified** — ask
   before writing `BRIEFING.md`, not after the worker returns something the
   human didn't ask for. Skip this step only when the task is already fully
   specified or is a repeat of a task type already clarified earlier in
   this session. Getting a confidently wrong BRIEFING to the worker fast is
   not faster than getting a right one to it five minutes later — the
   worker's tokens and the review cycle are not free, and re-dispatching
   after a mismatch costs more than asking upfront.
1. **Brief the worker.** Write `.agents/worker_<kind>_N/BRIEFING.md`: exact
   task, constraints ("only touch files under `workspace/`"), expected
   output. Also pick a unique Herdr agent name (`[a-z][a-z0-9_-]{0,31}`,
   e.g. `worker_agy_2`, `worker_codex_1`) — check it's not already live
   with `herdr agent list`.
2. **Dispatch.** macOS/Linux/Git-Bash/WSL:
   ```bash
   skills/dispatching-to-herdr-workers/scripts/dispatch-herdr-worker.sh \
     <absolute-workspace-path> \
     .agents/worker_<kind>_N \
     "<task prompt>" \
     <agent_name> \
     <kind> \
     [timeout_ms, default 300000] \
     [--isolation none|worktree] \
     [--task-id TASK-xxx]
   ```
   Windows (native cmd/PowerShell, no bash needed) or wherever Python is
   preferred — same arguments, same output files:
   ```bash
   python3 skills/dispatching-to-herdr-workers/scripts/dispatch-herdr-worker.py \
     <absolute-workspace-path> \
     .agents/worker_<kind>_N \
     "<task prompt>" \
     <agent_name> \
     <kind> \
     [timeout_ms, default 300000] \
     [--isolation none|worktree] \
     [--task-id TASK-xxx]
   ```
   Under the hood this runs, in order: (optionally) `git worktree add` for
   isolation, then `herdr pane split --current --direction right --cwd
   <workspace> --no-focus`, then `herdr agent start <agent_name> --kind
   <kind> --pane <pane_id> -- <per-kind native args>`, then `herdr agent
   prompt <agent_name> "<task, workspace path repeated>" --wait --timeout
   <timeout_ms>`, then `herdr agent get` + `herdr agent read` to capture
   the settled status and terminal output — with the delivery-confirmation
   check from the Lessons log applied before trusting any of it. It writes
   `DISPATCH.md`, `progress.md`, the raw `herdr_*.json` responses,
   `agent_output.txt`, and (if `--task-id` given) a task JSON file. Exit
   code: `0` = settled idle/done, `2` = settled blocked, `1` = no delivery
   confirmed / unknown / error, `3` = still working past timeout — check
   the exit code, don't just assume success.

   2b. **If the worker comes back `blocked`** (a question, an approval
   request, etc.), the script has already stopped — it will not resolve
   this for you. Take over interactively:
   ```bash
   herdr agent read <agent_name> --source recent-unwrapped --lines 120
   ```
   to see what it's waiting on, then either
   `herdr agent send-keys <agent_name> <key>` for a UI control (e.g. an
   approval dialog) or `herdr agent prompt <agent_name> "<answer>" --wait
   --timeout <ms>` for a text answer. Repeat until it settles idle/done.
   Log what happened in `progress.md` before moving on.

   2c. **If the script exits with `no_delivery_confirmed`,** don't assume
   the task genuinely failed — this status exists precisely because the
   underlying error code that would normally mean "never delivered" has
   been observed to be wrong before (see Lessons log). Inspect
   `agent_output.txt` yourself: if the prompt text is visibly in the
   transcript and the agent is working/done, it landed — the automated
   marker check missed it (e.g. an even-more-unusual wrap pattern) and you
   can proceed with self-check as normal. If the pane is genuinely empty
   past the banner, it really didn't land — retry manually via
   `herdr agent prompt`.
3. **Never dispatch two workers at the same absolute workspace path
   concurrently** (unless using worktree isolation — that's precisely what
   it's for). Same reasoning as never running two implementers on the same
   files in `subagent-driven-development`: conflicting writes, no lock.
   Also never reuse a live agent name — check `herdr agent list` first.
4. **Self-check — always, no exceptions, but cheap.** Before writing
   `handoff.md`, YOU (the orchestrator) directly inspect what the worker
   actually produced — `ls`/`cat` the file, run it, diff it, whatever takes
   one or two tool calls. Never accept a settled `idle`/`done` status alone:
   it has reported success even when the file landed in the wrong directory
   entirely, or was never actually created (see the Lessons log — twice).
   This step is not optional and does not need a subagent.

   **For worktree-isolated tasks:** `cd .worktrees/TASK-xxx && git diff HEAD`
   gives you a clean view of exactly what the worker changed. This is
   strictly better than inspecting individual files — you see every change,
   every new file, nothing hidden.
5. **Independent reviewer subagent — only for tasks that meet the bar.**
   Dispatch a Claude subagent (Agent tool) with a `reviewer_N/BRIEFING.md`
   when **any** of these are true:
   - The output will be relied on without the human re-checking it (feeds
     an automated next step, gets committed/shipped, or you'll report it
     done and move on).
   - The task involves non-trivial logic where a plausible-looking wrong
     answer is easy to miss by eyeballing (not just "does the file exist").
   - It's one of the first few dispatches of a new *kind* of task, OR a
     new agent *kind* you haven't run through this skill before — spend
     the review budget to calibrate whether it's reliable before trusting
     it lower-touch.
   - It touches shared/production code or data, or anything costly to
     get wrong.
   - The human explicitly flagged the task as important.

   **Skip the reviewer subagent** (self-check from step 4 is enough) for
   scratch/exploratory work, mechanical tasks you can fully verify yourself
   in one command, and repeat dispatches of a task type (and kind) that has
   already passed reviewer verification several times with no surprises.

   Don't let "it worked last time" quietly become the excuse to stop
   self-checking too — step 4 never goes away, only step 5 is conditional.

   **Reviewer MUST review the diff, not the worker report (enforced).**
   A worker can report success while having produced wrong output, or can
   accurately describe what it did while having done the wrong thing. The
   reviewer's BRIEFING.md must include these instructions:

   ```
   ## Review instructions (ENFORCED)

   1. ❌ DO NOT read or trust the worker's progress.md or self-report.
   2. ✅ Run `git diff` to see actual changes (or for worktree-isolated
      tasks: `cd .worktrees/TASK-xxx && git diff HEAD`).
   3. ✅ `cat`/inspect the actual changed files.
   4. ✅ Run tests if they exist for the changed code.
   5. ✅ Run build if applicable.
   6. ✅ VERDICT must be based on evidence from steps 2-5 only.

   Your VERDICT: PASS or FAIL must end your handoff.md, with a
   one-sentence reason citing specific evidence.
   ```

   When used: the reviewer independently inspects the actual workspace
   files and re-runs/re-checks the claim itself — never just re-parses the
   herdr JSON responses or the worker's progress.md. Its `handoff.md` must
   end with `VERDICT: PASS` or `VERDICT: FAIL` plus a one-sentence reason
   **citing specific evidence** (file path, diff line, test output).
6. **Gate.** Update `.agents/orchestrator/GATE_STATUS.md` for every worker
   (self-check result, and reviewer verdict if one was dispatched — write
   `reviewer: skipped (self-checked)` when step 5 didn't apply). Also
   update the task JSON status if using task tracking (`--task-id`). Only
   report the task done to the human once this line is clean.
7. **Cleanup.** You created the worker's pane, so you may close it
   (`herdr pane close <pane_id>`) once its `handoff.md` is written and no
   follow-up is expected — but leaving it alive costs nothing and preserves
   the ability to send one more prompt if review turns up a gap. Never
   close a pane or kill an agent you did not create.

   **For worktree-isolated tasks:** after merge, clean up with:
   ```bash
   git worktree remove .worktrees/TASK-xxx
   git branch -d task/TASK-xxx
   ```

## `agent_prompt_stalled` is UNKNOWN, not FAIL (v0.5.0)

This is critical enough to call out separately from the Lessons log.

`agent_prompt_stalled` is a Herdr heuristic that means "I didn't see the
agent's state change within the timeout." It does **NOT** reliably mean
the prompt was never delivered. Empirically (2026-08-13 smoke test), it has
fired on all 4 retry attempts while the prompt had actually landed on the
first attempt and the task completed correctly.

**The correct handling:**

```
agent_prompt_stalled
       ↓
    UNKNOWN (not FAIL)
       ↓
  herdr agent get <name>
       ↓
  herdr agent read <name>
       ↓
  inspect transcript for prompt text
     /       \
   YES       NO
    │         │
  WAIT      RETRY
  (task      (prompt was
  started)   never delivered)
```

**What this means in practice:**
- Never short-circuit to FAIL on `agent_prompt_stalled` alone.
- Never blindly retry without checking the transcript first — the prompt
  may already be running.
- The dispatch scripts implement this flow: retry loop + post-retry marker
  check in the pane transcript. Trust the marker check, not the error code.

## Lessons from real dispatches (running log)

Append to this list when a dispatch teaches you something non-obvious —
that's the point of keeping this skill in one file instead of re-learning
it every session.

- **2026-08-10, hello.py smoke test (agy, headless era):** `agy --print`
  without `--add-dir` reported `SUCCESS` while writing into its own scratch
  dir, not the workspace asked for. → the `--add-dir` quirk in the Per-kind
  quirks table above; scripts bake it in via `agent start ... --
  --add-dir <path>`.
- **2026-08-10, cross-platform:** the dispatch script is bash-only in one
  form — doesn't run on native Windows (cmd/PowerShell) without WSL or Git
  Bash. Added a behavior-identical Python port. Pick by platform, not by
  habit.
- **2026-08-10, helloworld-tabs-demo (agy, headless era):** two more lessons
  from one dispatch:
  - **Self-check with a naive substring match can false-negative.**
    Grepping the produced HTML for the literal string "Hello World" found
    nothing, because the worker had written
    `<h1>Hello <span class="gradient-text">World!</span></h1>` — the text
    was real and correctly displayed, just split by a tag. Self-check for
    *rendered/semantic* content, not raw substrings, before concluding
    something is missing.
  - **"SUCCESS" can hide scope creep, not just wrong location.** Asked for
    a "simple" hello-world page; got a full "Premium Dark & Glassmorphism"
    design system with an external CDN dependency (Google Fonts, Font
    Awesome) nobody asked for. Nothing was *broken* — the reported status
    was accurate this time — but the result didn't match intent. This is
    exactly what step 0 (clarify first) exists to prevent, and exactly
    what self-check should flag even when the worker's own report reads
    clean: note surprises (unrequested dependencies, scope beyond the
    brief), not just pass/fail.
  - When asked, the human owns the final call on both directions: keep an
    over-delivered result as-is, or skip a reviewer step the policy would
    otherwise recommend. Record whichever they choose in `handoff.md` /
    `GATE_STATUS.md` — don't let an explicit human decision look like a
    process gap on paper later.
- **2026-08-13, migration to Herdr-managed panes (agy):** replaced the
  headless `agy --print --dangerously-skip-permissions` mode entirely.
  Motivation: a one-shot subprocess can't be polled mid-task, can't take a
  follow-up prompt without a fresh full relaunch, and forced
  `--dangerously-skip-permissions` because nothing was present to answer an
  approval prompt. A Herdr-managed pane fixes all three: `herdr agent get`
  gives live `idle`/`working`/`blocked`/`done` status, `herdr agent prompt`
  can be called again on the same live agent, and a `blocked` status means
  an approval/question is genuinely waiting for the orchestrator to answer
  rather than being silently skipped. Tradeoff: this skill now hard-depends
  on running inside a Herdr session — no more headless/CI fallback.
- **2026-08-13, smoke test caught a real race (agy):** the very first
  `agent prompt --wait` sent immediately after `agent start` failed with
  `{"error":{"code":"agent_prompt_stalled",...}}` even though `agent get`
  reported `interactive_ready: true` and `agent_status: idle`. The prompt
  text never reached the pane (`state_change_seq` didn't move, box stayed
  empty) — but the script's old logic just read the post-prompt status as
  `idle` and reported success, which would have been a **false-positive**:
  no file was actually created. A manual retry of the exact same `agent
  prompt --wait` call one attempt later worked immediately and produced
  correct output. Fix: scripts retry up to 4 times with a 3s delay whenever
  the response's `error.code` is `agent_prompt_stalled`, and only read the
  settled status after a non-stalled response. **`agent_prompt_stalled` is
  UNKNOWN, not FAIL** — see the dedicated section above.
- **2026-08-13, two more races in the same smoke test (agy, but the first
  two are Herdr-level, not agy-specific):** (a) calling `herdr agent start`
  immediately after `herdr pane split` can hit `{"error":{"code":
  "agent_pane_busy","message":"... is not an available shell"}}` — the pane
  isn't an available shell yet even with no agent attached. Fixed the same
  way: retry with a short delay. (b) **herdr writes server errors as JSON
  to stderr, not stdout** (this is documented behavior, easy to miss) — a
  naive `"$(herdr ...)"` capture only sees stdout, so error-code-based retry
  logic silently never fires unless stderr is captured too. Both scripts
  capture stderr explicitly for every retryable call. (c) Even after fixing
  (b), `agent_prompt_stalled` itself turned out unreliable: on one dispatch
  it fired on **all 4** retry attempts, yet the prompt had actually landed
  on the first attempt and the task completed correctly — the error is a
  heuristic, not a reliable non-delivery signal. Fix: after the retry loop,
  check the pane transcript itself (`herdr agent read`) for the fixed
  prompt-template marker text ("Trong thư mục tuyệt đối...", present in
  every prompt this skill sends regardless of task content or kind) before
  trusting any status. No marker in the transcript → force status to
  `no_delivery_confirmed` and refuse to report success, no matter what
  `agent get` says. Lesson underneath all three: **when a new integration's
  error/status codes haven't been battle-tested, verify against the actual
  artifact (pane text, file contents) — never chain trust through an
  unverified status string, even in the "fixed" version of a script.**
  Because (a) and (b) are Herdr CLI behaviors, not agy behaviors, they were
  assumed to transfer to other kinds without re-verification when this
  skill was generalized — but that assumption itself hasn't been tested
  yet; treat it as a hypothesis, not a fact, until a codex (or other kind)
  dispatch actually confirms it.
- **2026-08-13, generalized beyond agy to any Herdr-supported kind:** added
  a `kind` parameter and the Per-kind quirks table above, so this skill
  (renamed from `dispatching-to-agy-workers`) can drive `codex` and, in
  principle, any other kind `herdr agent` supports. `codex` has no known
  workspace-scoping quirk yet (default: none) — but as of this rename it
  has **not yet been exercised in a real dispatch** through this skill, only
  reasoned about. Treat the first codex dispatch (and the first dispatch of
  any other new kind) like "a new kind of task" under the Review Policy:
  verify against real files, and update the quirks table and this log with
  whatever you actually observe — don't assume codex behaves like agy, and
  don't assume it behaves perfectly cleanly either.
- **2026-08-14, read https://herdr.dev/docs/agent-automation/ and tested
  every idea it suggested before adopting any of it:**
  - **`--timeout` is hard-bounded to `(3000, 300000]` ms.** Herdr rejects
    values outside that range rather than clamping. Our old default
    (300000) sits exactly at the ceiling, which is fine, but nothing
    stopped a caller from passing something bigger and getting a cryptic
    failure. Both scripts now validate `timeout_ms` and
    `HERDR_START_TIMEOUT_MS` up front and fail with a clear message. **For
    genuinely long tasks, there is no bigger single-call timeout to reach
    for** — loop `herdr agent wait <agent_name> --timeout 300000` instead
    of trying to raise this value.
  - **Tested and rejected: dropping `--wait` to dodge `agent_prompt_stalled`.**
    Hypothesis was that decoupling submission (`agent prompt` without
    `--wait`) from waiting (`agent wait` separately) would avoid the
    5-second-no-change stall check that's produced false failures before.
    Live test: `agent prompt <name> "<text>"` (no `--wait`) returned
    `{"...":"agent_prompted"}` — reporting success — **while the pane was
    still on agy's startup/account-check screen and the text never landed
    at all.** Without `--wait`, herdr gives zero feedback that delivery
    failed; it's strictly worse than the current retry+marker-check
    approach, not better. Kept `--wait`. Recorded here so nobody
    "optimizes" this away again without re-testing it first.
  - **New error code found: `{"error":{"code":"timeout","message":"timed
    out waiting for agent status"}}`,** distinct from
    `agent_prompt_stalled`. Observed when the target agent was already mid
    an unrelated task: the new prompt gets silently **queued** (visible in
    the transcript as a `▸ ...` line under "Press up to edit queued
    messages") instead of running immediately, and `--wait` can genuinely
    time out waiting for the queue to clear — this is a real "still busy"
    condition, not a delivery failure, and should not be blindly retried
    the way `agent_pane_busy`/`agent_prompt_stalled` are. Relevant mainly
    to step 2b (sending a follow-up prompt to an *existing* agent): check
    `herdr agent get <name>` is `idle` first, or expect your follow-up to
    queue behind whatever it's already doing.
  - **The idle/done false-positive isn't unique to `idle`.** A follow-up
    smoke test hit the *exact* original bug again, but this time settled
    as `done`: `agent prompt --wait` returned success with a bumped
    `state_change_seq` and no error at all, `agent get` reported `done`,
    and the pane transcript was still completely empty — nothing was ever
    typed. An earlier revision of the delivery-marker fix only re-checked
    the marker when `status == idle`, on the theory that `done` implies
    real completion; that theory was wrong and let this exact
    false-positive back through. Fixed by applying the marker check to
    **both** `idle` and `done` (herdr's own docs describe `done` as "the
    same underlying idle state after unseen background work finishes" —
    it was never a materially different state to begin with). Lesson on
    top of the lesson: a "fix" narrowed from a broader, already-verified
    check is itself a new claim that needs its own live re-test — it isn't
    grandfathered in by the original fix's testing.
  - Net result of this reading-and-testing pass: one genuine improvement
    shipped (timeout bounds), one plausible optimization tested and
    correctly discarded (dropping `--wait`), one new error class
    documented but intentionally not auto-retried (`timeout`/queued), and
    one self-inflicted regression caught and fixed before it reached
    main (`idle`-only marker scoping). All four came from combining the
    doc with live dispatches — reading the doc alone would have shipped
    the regression.
- **2026-08-24, v0.5.0 architecture improvements:** Five structural changes
  based on external review:
  - **Renamed** `agy-orchestrator` → `herdr-worker-orchestrator` to reflect
    the real architecture (Claude → Herdr → any worker kind, not agy-only).
  - **Stateful task ledger** with JSON task files in `.agents/tasks/` and a
    global `.agents/state.json` — enables resume-on-restart. Task status
    follows a well-defined state machine (pending → dispatching → working →
    verifying → passed/failed).
  - **Worker isolation** via `git worktree` — prevents workers from
    conflicting with Claude's working tree, enables safe parallel dispatch,
    and gives clean `git diff` boundaries for review.
  - **Diff-based review** enforced: reviewer BRIEFING.md now explicitly
    instructs the reviewer to ignore worker reports and review only actual
    diffs, files, and test/build output.
  - **`agent_prompt_stalled` = UNKNOWN** framing made explicit: not FAIL,
    requires inspect-then-decide flow. Scripts already implemented this
    correctly; documentation now matches.

## Confidence notes (as of 2026-08-24)

`agy` is a very new CLI (Google, ~May 2026). Community reports (GitHub
`google-antigravity/antigravity-cli#76`) describe `agy --print` producing no
stdout at all on some platforms/versions when stdout isn't a TTY — this was
the known suspect for empty-output headless dispatches; it does not apply
under the current Herdr-pane mode since agy now runs fully interactively
with its own real TTY inside the pane, not through a piped subprocess.

Herdr's exact `agent get`/`agent prompt` JSON response shapes are new
integration surface for this skill — the dispatch scripts extract fields
defensively (recursive key search rather than a fixed JSON path)
specifically because that shape hasn't been battle-tested across many
dispatches or across kinds yet. Treat the first several dispatches of any
given kind like the "first few dispatches of a new kind of task" case in
the Review Policy above — this applies doubly to any kind beyond `agy` and
`codex`, which have zero and one real verified dispatch respectively as of
this rename.

The state machine and worktree isolation features (v0.5.0) are new and have
not yet been exercised in real dispatches — they are structural improvements
based on design review, not battle-tested like the core dispatch flow. Use
them, but expect the first few uses to surface edge cases worth adding to
this Lessons log.
