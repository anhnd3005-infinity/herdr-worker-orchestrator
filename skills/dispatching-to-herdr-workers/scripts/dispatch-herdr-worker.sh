#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Dispatch one task to a CLI agent (any Herdr-supported kind: agy, codex,
# claude, gemini, ...) running INSIDE a Herdr-managed pane, and record a
# DISPATCH.md/progress.md scaffold for a .agents/ file-based orchestration.
#
# The worker lives in a real, persistent Herdr pane, so the orchestrator
# can poll its lifecycle (idle/working/blocked/done), read its terminal
# output, and send follow-up prompts without relaunching anything.
#
# Usage:
#   dispatch-herdr-worker.sh <workspace_abs_path> <agent_record_dir> <prompt> <agent_name> <kind> [timeout_ms] [--isolation none|worktree] [--task-id TASK-xxx]
#
#   workspace_abs_path   Absolute path the worker is allowed to read/write.
#                         Passed to `herdr pane split --cwd` AND repeated
#                         inside the prompt. Some kinds ALSO need a native
#                         workspace-scoping flag on top of cwd (see the
#                         KIND_NATIVE_ARGS table below) --- e.g. agy does
#                         not reliably use its launching cwd as its
#                         workspace without an explicit --add-dir, and will
#                         silently write into its own scratch dir while
#                         still reporting success if you skip it. Not every
#                         kind has this quirk; codex has none known so far.
#   agent_record_dir      Where to write DISPATCH.md, progress.md, and the
#                         raw herdr JSON responses (e.g. .agents/worker_agy_2/).
#   prompt                Task text. The workspace path is prefixed automatically.
#   agent_name            Unique Herdr agent name for this worker
#                         (must match [a-z][a-z0-9_-]{0,31}, unique among
#                         live agents). Used to target every later
#                         `herdr agent ...` call (read/send-keys/prompt/wait).
#   kind                  Herdr agent kind: agy, codex, claude, gemini, ...
#                         (run `herdr agent` to see the full supported list).
#                         Only `agy` and `codex` have been exercised against
#                         this script so far --- see KIND_NATIVE_ARGS below.
#                         Any other kind runs with no extra native args
#                         (cwd-only) until it earns its own case here.
#   timeout_ms            Optional, default 300000 (5m). Passed to
#                         `herdr agent prompt --timeout`.
#
# Requires: HERDR_ENV=1 (this must run from inside a Herdr-managed pane),
# `herdr` on PATH, `jq` on PATH, and the requested kind's own CLI installed
# and present in `herdr agent`'s supported kind list.
#
# This script only does the deterministic happy path: split pane, start
# agent, send the first prompt, wait for it to settle, read the result. If
# the worker ends up `blocked` (a question, an approval prompt, etc.), this
# script does NOT try to resolve that --- it reports the blocked status and
# exits 2. The orchestrator must then take over interactively via
# `herdr agent read/send-keys/prompt <agent_name>`.

# `agent_prompt_stalled` proved unreliable in practice (2026-08-13 smoke
# test, agy): it fired on every one of 4 retry attempts even though the
# prompt HAD landed and the task completed correctly. Trusting the error
# alone would wrongly report failure; trusting a settled `idle` status
# alone would repeat the ORIGINAL false-positive bug (idle because nothing
# ever ran). So require actual delivery evidence: our prompt template
# always starts with the fixed Vietnamese marker below regardless of task
# content or kind --- if it never appears in the pane transcript, the
# prompt never landed, full stop, no matter what any status code says.
#
# Compare with whitespace stripped on both sides: a narrow pane makes the
# agent's TUI hard-wrap the marker across multiple lines (e.g. "Trong thư
# mục" / "tuyệt đối" on separate lines) even under `--source
# recent-unwrapped`, which only re-joins Herdr's own soft-wrap bookkeeping,
# not text the app itself already wrapped when rendering at that column
# width. A single-line substring/grep match would miss that split and
# false-negative. Stripping only ASCII whitespace bytes (space/tab/CR/LF)
# is UTF-8-safe: those byte values never appear inside a multi-byte UTF-8
# sequence, so Vietnamese diacritics survive intact.
#
# Only override when STATUS is `idle` or `done` --- herdr's own docs
# define `done` as "the same underlying idle state after unseen background
# work finishes", i.e. a settled state, same as idle. (2026-08-14 smoke
# test found the exact original bug recurring under `done` specifically:
# `agent prompt --wait` returned success with a bumped state_change_seq and
# no error at all, `agent get` reported `done`, yet the pane was
# completely empty --- scoping the marker-check to `idle` only, as an
# earlier version of this fix did, let that false positive straight
# through. Don't narrow this again without re-testing both states.) Per
# https://herdr.dev/docs/agent-automation/, an explicit `agent read` can
# return `agent_not_idle` / incomplete alternate-screen history while the
# agent is genuinely `working` --- so a missing marker while `working` may
# just mean the read caught it mid-render, not that delivery failed.
# Forcing `no_delivery_confirmed` in that case would mislabel a legitimately
# slow, still-running task as a failure. `blocked` is already handled on
# its own below regardless of the marker.
