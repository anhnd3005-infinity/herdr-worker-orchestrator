"""Cross-platform twin of dispatch-herdr-worker.sh --- same behavior, no
bash required. Use this on Windows (native cmd/PowerShell, no WSL/Git Bash
needed) or anywhere Python is preferred over a shell script.

Dispatch one task to a CLI agent (any Herdr-supported kind: agy, codex,
claude, gemini, ...) running INSIDE a Herdr-managed pane, and record a
DISPATCH.md/progress.md scaffold for a .agents/ file-based orchestration.

The worker lives in a real, persistent Herdr pane, so the orchestrator can
poll its lifecycle (idle/working/blocked/done), read its terminal output,
and send follow-up prompts without relaunching anything.

Usage:
    python3 dispatch-herdr-worker.py <workspace_abs_path> <agent_record_dir> <prompt> <agent_name> <kind> [timeout_ms] [--isolation none|worktree] [--task-id TASK-xxx]

    workspace_abs_path   Absolute path the worker is allowed to read/write.
                         Passed to `herdr pane split --cwd` AND repeated
                         inside the prompt. Some kinds ALSO need a native
                         workspace-scoping flag on top of cwd (see
                         KIND_NATIVE_ARGS below) --- e.g. agy does not
                         reliably use its launching cwd as its workspace
                         without an explicit --add-dir, and will silently
                         write into its own scratch dir while still
                         reporting success if you skip it. Not every kind
                         has this quirk; codex has none known so far.
    agent_record_dir      Where to write DISPATCH.md, progress.md, and the
                         raw herdr JSON responses (e.g. .agents/worker_agy_2/).
    prompt                Task text. The workspace path is prefixed
                         automatically.
    agent_name            Unique Herdr agent name for this worker (must
                         match [a-z][a-z0-9_-]{0,31}, unique among live
                         agents). Used to target every later
                         `herdr agent ...` call.
    kind                  Herdr agent kind: agy, codex, claude, gemini, ...
                         (run `herdr agent` for the full supported list).
                         Only `agy` and `codex` have been exercised against
                         this script so far --- see KIND_NATIVE_ARGS below.
                         Any other kind runs with no extra native args
                         (cwd-only) until it earns its own entry.
    timeout_ms            Optional, default 300000 (5m). Passed to
                         `herdr agent prompt --timeout`.

Requires: HERDR_ENV=1 (this must run from inside a Herdr-managed pane),
`herdr` on PATH, and the requested kind's own CLI installed and present in
`herdr agent`'s supported kind list.

This script only does the deterministic happy path: split pane, start
agent, send the first prompt, wait for it to settle, read the result. If
the worker ends up `blocked` (a question, an approval prompt, etc.), this
script does NOT try to resolve that --- it reports the blocked status and
exits 2. The orchestrator must then take over interactively via
`herdr agent read/send-keys/prompt <agent_name>`.

    # pane transcript, the prompt never landed, full stop, no matter what
    # any status code says.
    #
    # Compare with whitespace stripped on both sides: a narrow pane makes
    # the agent's TUI hard-wrap the marker across multiple lines (e.g.
    # "Trong thư mục" / "tuyệt đối" on separate lines) even under
    # `recent-unwrapped`, which only re-joins Herdr's own soft-wrap
    # bookkeeping, not text the app itself already wrapped when rendering

    # and false-negative.
    #
    # Only override when status is `idle` or `done` --- herdr's own docs
    # define `done` as "the same underlying idle state after unseen
    # background work finishes", i.e. a settled state, same as idle.
    # (2026-08-14 smoke test found the exact original bug recurring under
    # `done` specifically: `agent prompt --wait` returned success with a
    # bumped state_change_seq and no error at all, `agent get` reported
    # `done`, yet the pane was completely empty --- scoping the
    # marker-check to `idle` only, as an earlier version of this fix did,
    # let that false positive straight through. Don't narrow this again
    # without re-testing both states.) Per
    # https://herdr.dev/docs/agent-automation/, an explicit `agent read`
    # can return `agent_not_idle` / incomplete alternate-screen history
    # while the agent is genuinely `working` --- so a missing marker while
