# herdr-worker-orchestrator

Claude Code as orchestrator, CLI agent workers of any
[Herdr](https://herdr.dev)-supported kind (`agy`, `codex`, and in principle
any other kind Herdr recognizes) running interactively inside
Herdr-managed panes — coordinated through a **stateful** `.agents/` ledger
with task tracking, worker isolation via `git worktree`, and diff-based
review. Claude clarifies scope before dispatching, always self-checks a
worker's output directly against real files (never trusts a status code
alone), and only spins up an independent reviewer for tasks that meet a
stated importance bar.

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), **running inside a
  Herdr-managed pane** (see step 1 — this is the one thing people miss)
- **Herdr** itself
- At least one worker CLI: **`agy`**, **`codex`**, or another kind `herdr
  agent` supports

## Quick install

### 1. Install Herdr, then run Claude Code *inside* it

Herdr is a hard prerequisite — the skill checks `HERDR_ENV=1` before doing
anything and refuses to run outside a Herdr-managed pane. Installing Herdr
is not enough by itself: **Claude Code has to actually be running inside a
pane Herdr created**, not a plain terminal.

**macOS (Homebrew — official core formula):**
```bash
brew install herdr
brew services start herdr        # keep it running in the background, or:
/opt/homebrew/opt/herdr/bin/herdr server   # run it directly, no service
```

**Other platforms:** see [herdr.dev](https://herdr.dev) for the current
Linux/Windows install steps (not independently verified from this machine,
so no exact command is claimed here).

Then open/attach a Herdr session and start Claude Code **from inside one of
its panes** — e.g. Herdr's own UI, or `herdr session attach <name>`.

✅ **Verify before moving on:**
```bash
herdr --version
echo "$HERDR_ENV"    # must print 1
```
If `$HERDR_ENV` is empty, you're in a plain terminal, not a Herdr pane —
nothing past this point will work until that's fixed.

### 2. Install the worker CLI(s) you'll dispatch to

```bash
# agy (Antigravity CLI, Google)
curl -fsSL https://antigravity.google/cli/install.sh | bash        # macOS/Linux
irm https://antigravity.google/cli/install.ps1 | iex                # Windows PowerShell
curl -fsSL https://antigravity.google/cli/install.cmd -o install.cmd && install.cmd && del install.cmd  # Windows CMD
```

For `codex` or any other kind, install it per its own docs.

✅ **Verify:**
```bash
agy --help                # or the equivalent for your kind
herdr agent               # kinds line should list what you installed
```

On **Windows**, the dispatch script has a pure-Python twin
(`dispatch-herdr-worker.py`) — no WSL or Git Bash needed just for this
plugin.

### 3. Install the plugin

```
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/anhnd3005-infinity/claude-agy-orchestrator.git
/plugin install herdr-worker-orchestrator@herdr-worker-orchestrator-marketplace
```

Repo is **public** — no SSH key, no GitHub login needed. (SSH also works if
preferred: `git@github.com:anhnd3005-infinity/claude-agy-orchestrator.git`.)

✅ **Verify:**
```
/plugin
```
should list `herdr-worker-orchestrator@herdr-worker-orchestrator-marketplace` as enabled.
Works from **any** project on the machine, not just this repo.

### Updating later

New commits land on `main` over time (see Version history at the bottom).
You do **not** need to re-add the marketplace or reinstall from scratch —
two commands:

```
/plugin marketplace update
/plugin update herdr-worker-orchestrator@herdr-worker-orchestrator-marketplace
```

The first refreshes the marketplace catalog from git (pulls latest
commits); the second actually installs the new version — running only the
first does not update the plugin itself. From a plain terminal instead of
an interactive session (e.g. scripting/CI), use `claude plugin update
herdr-worker-orchestrator@herdr-worker-orchestrator-marketplace -y` (the `-y` skips the
confirmation prompt; it's required outside an interactive session, ignored
inside one). There's no "update all" — update by plugin name.

✅ **Verify the version landed:** re-run `/plugin` and check the version
number shown against the one in this README's Version history.

### You're set up. Try it:

> "Dùng agy làm worker để tạo file hello.py, chạy thử, rồi báo kết quả cho tôi."

Claude will ask a clarifying question first if anything about scope, style,
"done", or which kind is ambiguous — that's expected, not a bug.

## How to use it

No slash command required — this is a **skill**, Claude pulls it in
automatically when a request matches. Just ask normally:

> "Dispatch this to a codex worker qua Herdr, rồi tự self-check kết quả."

To force it explicitly instead of relying on auto-match:

```
/herdr-dispatch Tạo file X bằng agy, chạy thử, báo kết quả cho tôi.
```

Add "quan trọng"/"important" in the task text to force an independent
reviewer subagent regardless of the normal importance-bar check.

Read `skills/dispatching-to-herdr-workers/SKILL.md` for the full process —
one file, worth reading end to end once.

## How it works
![AI Coding Workflow](./ai_coding_workflow_animated.gif)


*(Under the hood, "dispatch" and "checks the real files" are each a small
sequence of `herdr pane`/`herdr agent` calls with retries and a ledger
written to `.agents/` — see the full step-by-step process in `SKILL.md` if
you want that detail.)*

**The rules that matter most:**
1. **Never trust a status code alone.** Real dispatches caught `agy`
   reporting success while writing to the wrong directory, a fresh pane
   returning `agent_pane_busy`, and `agent_prompt_stalled` firing even when
   the prompt had actually landed — every one only caught by checking the
   real file or pane transcript. Self-check is never skippable, even when
   the reviewer subagent is.
2. Asking "what do you mean by simple" costs one message. Discovering the
   worker overshot scope costs a whole dispatch cycle. Clarify first.
3. **A worker kind is only as trusted as its track record.** `agy` has
   several real dispatches behind it; `codex` or any other kind is new
   integration surface the first time you use it — treat its first
   dispatch like a new task type, not a known quantity.

## State machine & resume

v0.5.0 introduces a **stateful task ledger** in `.agents/`. Each dispatched
task gets a JSON file in `.agents/tasks/` with a well-defined status
lifecycle:

```
pending → dispatching → working → verifying → passed
                ↓           ↓         ↓
              failed     blocked    failed
                           ↓
                        resolved → verifying → ...
```

If Claude restarts mid-orchestration, it reads `.agents/state.json` and
the task files to find any `working`/`dispatching`/`blocked` tasks, inspects
their Herdr agents, and resumes — no state is lost to compaction or
session restart.

See `SKILL.md` § "State Machine & Resume" for the full schema and flow.

## Worker isolation

By default, workers run in the same working directory as Claude. For tasks
that touch shared/production code, v0.5.0 adds **git worktree isolation**:

```
Project
├── main worktree        ← Claude works here
├── .worktrees/TASK-001  ← Worker 1 (isolated)
└── .worktrees/TASK-002  ← Worker 2 (isolated)
```

Enable with `--isolation worktree` on the dispatch scripts. The worker gets
its own branch, and after verification the orchestrator merges the diff
back. This makes parallel dispatch safe and prevents workers from
accidentally breaking Claude's working tree.

See `SKILL.md` § "Worker Isolation" for the full flow.

## Known gotchas

- **No Herdr session → nothing works.** `HERDR_ENV` must be `1`. There is
  no headless fallback.
- **`agy` needs `--add-dir`; other kinds might not.** Handled by a small
  per-kind quirks table in the dispatch scripts — `codex` needs nothing
  extra (reasoned about, not yet dispatch-verified).
- **`--timeout` is capped at 300000 ms (5 min) per call**, hard-rejected
  above that. For longer tasks, loop `herdr agent wait <name> --timeout
  300000` after dispatch instead of raising the number. Exit code `3` means
  exactly this: still working past the timeout, not a failure.
- **`agent_pane_busy` and `agent_prompt_stalled`** can fire right after
  `pane split`/`agent start` even when nothing is actually wrong — both
  scripts retry, and cross-check the real pane transcript before trusting
  any status. Don't hand-roll the `herdr` sequence without one of them.
- **`agent_prompt_stalled` is UNKNOWN, not FAIL.** This status means the
  prompt *may or may not* have been delivered — it's a heuristic, not a
  reliable signal. The correct handling is:
  ```
  agent_prompt_stalled
         ↓
      UNKNOWN
         ↓
    herdr agent get + herdr agent read
         ↓
    inspect transcript for prompt text
       /       \
     YES       NO
      │         │
    WAIT      RETRY
    (task      (prompt never
    started)   delivered)
  ```
  The dispatch scripts already implement this flow (retry + marker check).
  Never short-circuit to FAIL on `agent_prompt_stalled` alone.
- **`done` is not safer to trust than `idle`.** Both are "settled" states
  and both have independently produced a false-positive (settled + zero
  error + completely empty pane). The delivery-marker check covers both.
- **Don't drop `--wait`** to dodge a flaky stall error — tested live to be
  worse: herdr reports success immediately with zero signal that delivery
  actually failed.
- **herdr writes errors to stderr, not stdout** — easy to miss when
  scripting your own `herdr` calls.
- **Naive string checks during self-check can false-negative** on content
  split across HTML tags or wrapped terminal lines. Check meaning, not raw
  substrings.
- **A worker doing exactly what it was told can still overshoot intent.**
  That's a step-0 (clarify first) problem, not a step-4 (self-check) one.
- **Reviewers must review the diff, not the worker's report.** A worker
  can report success while having produced wrong output, or can accurately
  describe what it did while having done the wrong thing. The reviewer's
  job is `git diff` + actual file inspection + tests/build — never just
  re-reading the worker's `progress.md`.

Full history and exact repro steps for each of these: `skills/
dispatching-to-herdr-workers/SKILL.md`'s "Lessons from real dispatches" log.

## What's in here

- `skills/dispatching-to-herdr-workers/` — the skill: `SKILL.md` (process,
  per-kind quirks table, review policy, state machine, isolation, full
  lessons log) + `scripts/dispatch-herdr-worker.sh` / `.py`
  (behavior-identical dispatch wrappers, bash and pure-Python).
- `commands/herdr-dispatch.md` — `/herdr-dispatch <task>`, forces the skill
  instead of relying on auto-match.
- `.agents/` — stateful task ledger (tasks/, runs/, state.json) plus a
  real worked-example dispatch kept for reference.

## Why this exists

`agy plugin install` lets *agy itself* run Superpowers-style skills
natively. This plugin is the opposite shape: Claude Code stays the
controller, and dispatches to an external, heterogeneous worker over
Herdr — useful when you want a different CLI's models/cost profile doing
execution while Claude coordinates and reviews. Doesn't require Superpowers
either way.

**Note on cost:** not automatically cheaper than asking Claude directly — a
trivial task can cost *more* total tokens across both providers (measured:
~150k tokens on the agy side for a "create hello.py" smoke test). What it
does is shift execution-heavy work off Claude's metered usage onto a
separate provider's quota — a budget-allocation tool, not a
total-cost-reduction one.

## Worked examples

Real dispatches, kept as evidence:

**1. `hello.py` smoke test** (this repo). First-ever dispatch, headless
era. Attempt 1 silently wrote to agy's scratch dir despite reporting
success; attempt 2 (with `--add-dir`) worked and was independently
verified. Produced the `--add-dir` quirk and the ledger convention.

**2. `helloworld-tabs-demo`** (a separate project). Asked for "1 website
đơn giản helloworld." Dispatched without clarifying "đơn giản" first (a
mistake — added step 0 to the process); agy delivered a full
"Premium Dark & Glassmorphism" site, accurate to the letter, well beyond
intended spirit. `grep -i "hello world"` false-negatived on text split
across an HTML tag — manual check found it. Human chose to keep the
over-delivered design; independent reviewer skipped since a human looked
directly.

**3. Herdr-pane migration smoke tests** (`workspace4`–`workspace9`,
cleaned up after). Six live dispatches pressure-testing the new pane mode:
caught `agent_prompt_stalled` producing a false-positive `idle` status,
`agent_pane_busy` right after pane split, herdr writing errors to stderr
(missed by a stdout-only capture), and `agent_prompt_stalled` firing on all
4 retries once even though the task had genuinely completed. Final run:
fully automatic, correct file, correct exit code.

**4. Doc-driven optimization pass** (2026-08-14). Read
[herdr.dev/docs/agent-automation](https://herdr.dev/docs/agent-automation/)
and tested every idea before adopting it: shipped `--timeout` bounds
validation; tested and *rejected* dropping `--wait` (made delivery
detection strictly worse, confirmed live); found a new `timeout`/queued-
prompt error distinct from `agent_prompt_stalled`; caught and fixed a
self-inflicted regression where a delivery-check fix only covered `idle`
and let the identical bug back through under `done`.

All of the above are captured in `SKILL.md`'s "Lessons from real
dispatches" log, so the next dispatch starts from what these already
learned.

## Version history

- **0.5.0** — renamed from `agy-orchestrator` to `herdr-worker-orchestrator`
  to reflect the real architecture (Claude → Herdr → any worker kind);
  stateful `.agents/` ledger with task JSON files and resume-on-restart;
  `git worktree` isolation mode for safe parallel dispatch; enforced
  diff-based review (reviewer inspects `git diff` + actual files, never
  trusts worker report); explicit `agent_prompt_stalled` = UNKNOWN framing
  with inspect-then-decide flow.
- **0.4.1** — doc-driven optimization pass (see Worked example 4): timeout
  bounds validation + new `working` exit code (`3`), `--wait`-dropping
  tested and rejected, new `timeout` error documented, `idle`-only
  delivery-check regression found and fixed to cover `done` too.
- **0.4.0** — replaced headless `agy --print` with Herdr-managed
  interactive panes (lifecycle polling, follow-up prompts, live approval
  instead of `--dangerously-skip-permissions`); fixed 3 real races via live
  smoke testing; generalized from agy-only to any Herdr-supported kind via
  a per-kind native-args table; renamed `dispatching-to-agy-workers` →
  `dispatching-to-herdr-workers`, `/agy-dispatch` → `/herdr-dispatch`.
- **0.3.0** — cross-platform dispatch: pure-Python port, no WSL/Git Bash
  required just for this plugin.
- **0.2.0** — step 0 (clarify before dispatching), tiered review policy,
  `/agy-dispatch` slash command.
- **0.1.0** — initial skill: `.agents/` ledger convention, `--add-dir`
  gotcha, mandatory reviewer, dispatch script, self-hosted marketplace.
